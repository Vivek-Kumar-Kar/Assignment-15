Quick Sort and Merge Sort Comparison:

Advantages of Quick Sort
	
	1.It is one of the fastest sorting algorithm.
	2.It is simple and easy to understand than some of the other algorithm.
	3.It does not require additional space to perform the sorting.

Disadvantages of Quick Sort
	
	1.Mostly used for array, because its not very suitable for other datastructures such as linkedlist.
	2.Pivot selection is very important, poorly selected pivot can affect the performance.


Comparison: 

	1.Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.
	2.Quick sort is more efficient and works faster than merge sort in case of smaller array size or datasets.

Example:

	In milliseconds, Quick Sort taking 1.5827 ms but the Merge Sort taking 1.836 ms.
